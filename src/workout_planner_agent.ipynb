        "Description: \n",
        "\n",
        "This file implements a LangGraph-based agent that utilizes custom workout planner tools to generate personalized fitness plans. Key components include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Environment Setup:\n",
        "   - Configures LangChain tracing and project settings\n",
        "   - Manages API keys for OpenAI and LangChain\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Tool Integration:\n",
        "   - Incorporates DuckDuckGoSearchRun, WorkoutPlannerTool, and LlmWorkoutPlannerTool\n",
        "   - Binds tools to a ChatOpenAI model (GPT-4)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Agent State and Workflow Definition:\n",
        "   - Defines AgentState using TypedDict for managing conversation history\n",
        "   - Creates a StateGraph workflow with agent and action nodes\n",
        "   - Implements logic for conditional edges to determine workflow progression\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Execution Functions:\n",
        "   - run_workflow: Asynchronous function to stream workflow updates\n",
        "   - execute_workflow: Synchronous wrapper for running the workflow\n",
        "   - pretty_print_result: Formats and displays the final workout plan\n",
        "\n",
        "5. LangGraph Integration:\n",
        "   - Utilizes LangGraph components like StateGraph and ToolNode\n",
        "   - Compiles the workflow into an executable application\n",
        "\n",
        "This script orchestrates the entire process of generating a workout plan, from user input to final output, leveraging AI-powered tools and a sophisticated graph-based workflow. It demonstrates the integration of custom tools with language models in a flexible, extensible architecture suitable for complex, multi-step AI tasks.\n",
